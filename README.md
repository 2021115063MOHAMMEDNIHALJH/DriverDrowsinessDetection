# Driver State Prediction and Drowsiness Detection

## Overview

This project is an IoT-based driver state prediction and drowsiness detection system. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNN) to monitor the driver's eye movements, yawning, and head position to detect signs of drowsiness and distraction. The system integrates with Arduino to alert the driver and notify passengers in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Uses CNN to analyze eye movements, yawning, and head position.
- **Drowsiness Detection:** Detects if the driver is closing their eyes or yawning.
- **Distraction Detection:** Monitors if the driver turns their head away from the road.
- **Alerts:** 
  - **Buzzer:** Alerts the driver when signs of drowsiness or distraction are detected.
  - **LCD Display:** Notifies passengers about the driver's state.
  - **LED Indicators:** Visual signals for driver drowsiness and distraction.

## Technologies Used

- **IoT**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Real-Time Image Dataset**
- **Arduino**

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DriverStatePrediction.git
   cd DriverStatePrediction
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**
   - Install the necessary Python libraries
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Ensure you have the Arduino IDE installed.

3. **Train the Model**
   - Use the provided dataset or your own to train the CNN model.
   - Follow the instructions in the `model_training` directory.

4. **Upload Code to Arduino**
   - Connect your Arduino board.
   - Open the `arduino/DriverAlert.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. **Run the Detection Script**
   ```bash
   python detect_driver_state.py
   ```

2. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - The system will start monitoring the driver's state in real-time.
   - Alerts will be triggered based on the driver's eye movements, yawning, and head position.
